## Are Industrial Companies in the Czech Republic Able to Predict the Short-term Future of the Economy?

Economists, politicians or managers always want to know what mood the economy is in. Economic surveys, Short-term statistics and Business tendency survey, can give the   answer to this question. However, the short-term business statistics describe real data about companies; the results are published with a two months delay. By way of contrast, the Business tendency survey indicates predictions of this economic development. Since the Business tendency survey is based on opinions of selected companies, a quality and confidence of predictions in the previously mentioned survey is opened to discussion. The article focuses on evaluation predictions and the real development of industrial companies in the Czech Republic. Authors are comparing results from Short-term statistics in the industry and the Business tendency survey. The Czech Statistical Office collects data from the both surveys. Using mathematical and statistical methods, authors want to scale and categorize real data-based economic development, recorded by short-term business statistics, into categories corresponding within predictions, offered by Business tendency survey, such that the appropriate categories from the both sources correlate themselves enough. The categorization attempt is performed for real data of two economic indicators – employment and sales. In case the categorization of real data is successful, Business tendency surveys published without any significant delay can provide sufficient and early idea about near future economic development. Furthermore, the results of the analysis can help to understand respondents´answer in the Business tendency survey and possibly update methodology, will be used to assemble indicators of the trust.
